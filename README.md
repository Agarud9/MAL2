# Machine Learning 2 - University Assignments

This repository contains all assignments completed for the Machine Learning 2 course during the semester. Data is not included in this repository, only the notebook with all cells pre-run is provided.

**1. Speech Recognition with Neural Networks**
   
Implements a fully connected and a convolutional neural network to classify spoken digits from audio data. Compares model performance and optimizes hyperparameters to enhance accuracy and minimize overfitting​.

**2. Handwriting Generation with cGAN**
   
Utilizes a conditional GAN trained on EMNIST to generate handwritten letters. Includes a function for creating handwritten representations of input strings and visualizes model outputs​.

**3. Spam Classification with Language Models**
   
Trains and evaluates two language models to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Compares model architectures and embedding approaches, optimizing for classification metric such as precision.
